# ServerManager
The repo for the Discord bot, ServerManager.

This will require `dotenv` (https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). Make a file called `.env` and add `BOT_TOKEN='<bot token>'` (replacing `<bot token>` with your bot token.)

The code will automatically add a file called `AuditLog.txt` in the `cogs/` directory. This will be the audit log of the bot.
